-post data v1 useful for posting data across multiple tables
each line includes table name and data that goes into it
one post with diverse data across diverse tables
data from 1000s of sensors and 500 post to 500 different tables all at once - this theoretically could use up all the memory - 
however, it is not as fast as new bulk method - to single table
-if uploading billion points to a single table use new method get doc from Justin
